# hospital-preauth-workflow-n8n
An end-to-end n8n-based automation
1. Problem Statement
In mid-size Indian hospitals, insurance pre-authorization is one of the most broken operational workflows.
Based on on-ground observation:
Verification teams manually collect documents across WhatsApp, email, and HIS
Insurers respond slowly or miss required documents
Follow-ups are manual, inconsistent, and often forgotten
Staff spend most of their time status checking instead of decision making
